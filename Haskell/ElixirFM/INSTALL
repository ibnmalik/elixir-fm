INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

This package is prepared with Cabal. You need some Haskell compiler installed
that understands Cabal and Haddock.

    http://www.haskell.org/ghc/
    http://www.haskell.org/hugs/

    http://www.haskell.org/cabal/
    http://www.haskell.org/haddock/


1)  Unpack the source distribution of this package and move to its root
    directory. You have probably done so already, since you are reading these
    instructions.

2)  From the command line, run the following (runhaskell is runghc or runhugs):

        runhaskell Setup.hs --help

    You can then build the package, install it, generate the documentation, ...

        runhaskell Setup.hs configure
        runhaskell Setup.hs build
        runhaskell Setup.hs install
        runhaskell Setup.hs haddock

    Alternatively, you can load Setup.hs into the interpreters (Hugs, GHCi) and
    run the following commands from within them:

    	:load Setup.hs

    	:main --help

    	:main configure
    	:main build
    	:main install
    	:main haddock


If you need more help, please consult the Cabal documentation website.
