ElixirFM - Interfaces to the ElixirFM system in Haskell

The ElixirFM module reimplements some of the functionality of the
ElixirFM system written in Haskell.

In particular, the ElixirFM::Resolve and ElixirFM::Data::Compose
modules provide the algorithms and data for advanced Arabic
morphological analysis, see also the elixir-resolve executable.
Other applications, such as morphological generation, can also be
implemented with ElixirFM.
